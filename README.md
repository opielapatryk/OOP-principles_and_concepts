# OOP - Principles and concepts

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle advocates for a class or module to have only one reason to change. In simpler terms, it should do one thing and do it well. By adhering to SRP, your code becomes more modular, making it easier to understand and maintain.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend a classâ€™s behavior without modifying it.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should be able to replace its parent class without breaking the code.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. This means that you should not have to implement methods that you do not need.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. This means that you should not have to change your code when you change the implementation of a module.
